## Contribution üö∏

For a common compatible development and testing environment we'll be utilizing the following versions

```
Flutter : 3.22.2
Dart SDK : 3.4.3
JDK : 19.0.2
Android NDK : 25.1.8937393
Android SDK : 34.0.0
```
You don't have to stick to the versions, as long as you can compile and test the project with a tool that has a different version. 
If necessary, the versions mentioned above can be updated. 
Any changes about the development environment should also be stated in this readme file.


Before a pull request run the following commands to be sure that;

- The source code is formatted.

```sh
$ flutter format --set-exit-if-changed lib test
```

- The source code has no issues.

```sh
$ flutter analyze lib test
```

- All tests passes.

```sh
$ flutter test --no-pub --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

- Code coverage is enough. 

So, new tests should be added belong the new codes to keep ![coverage][coverage_badge]

We have a simple bash script [lintool.sh](lintool.sh) to speed up the preparation process. Feel free to use and it.

```sh
$ ./lintool.sh
